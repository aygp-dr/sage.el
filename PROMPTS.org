#+STARTUP: overview

* README: How to Use This Template

This document serves as a *from-scratch development template* for creating AI-assisted software projects using the proven methodologies discovered in the Sage development process.

** For Iterative Development
Each iteration follows this pattern:
1. Start with this template
2. Document every prompt in real-time
3. Track methodology discoveries
4. Rebuild template with learnings
5. Repeat for continuous improvement

** Core Philosophy
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Document every prompt, track every decision, enable perfect reproduction."
#+END_QUOTE

* Phase 1: Initial Vision and Concept

** The Three Foundation Prompts
Every successful AI-assisted project begins with these three critical prompts:

*** 1. Technology and Scope Definition
#+BEGIN_SRC
"I want to [DESCRIBE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY] using [TECHNOLOGY STACK] in a [FORMAT/INTERFACE] format"
#+END_SRC

*Example from Sage:*
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"i want to have a simple, simple console app in clojurescript that just makes calls to curl [Gemini API endpoint] but in a repl-ish format"
#+END_QUOTE

*** 2. User Interface and Interaction Design  
#+BEGIN_SRC
"The [COMMANDS/INTERFACE] should use [SPECIFIC PATTERN/STRUCTURE]"
#+END_SRC

*Example from Sage:*
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"the exit and help commands should use a slash structure"
#+END_QUOTE

*** 3. Development Methodology Decision
#+BEGIN_SRC
"I want to start by using [METHODOLOGY/APPROACH] to [ENSURE QUALITY/SAFETY/STRUCTURE]"
#+END_SRC

*Example from Sage:*
#+BEGIN_QUOTE  
"i want to start by using formal methods to describe the interfaces or expectations of the system"
#+END_QUOTE

** Vision Documentation Template
#+BEGIN_SRC org
*** Project: [PROJECT NAME]
*** Technology Stack: [LANGUAGES/FRAMEWORKS/TOOLS]
*** Interface Type: [CLI/WEB/API/DESKTOP]
*** Quality Approach: [TESTING/FORMAL-METHODS/TDD/BDD]
*** Success Criteria: [WHAT CONSTITUTES SUCCESS]
#+END_SRC

* Phase 2: Literate Programming and Structure Generation

** The .org File Generation Pattern
The most powerful pattern discovered: *generate comprehensive project structure through literate programming files*.

** Setup File Generation Sequence
*** 1. SETUP.org - Foundation
#+BEGIN_SRC
"show a SETUP.org that just builds out those initial files"
#+END_SRC

*Purpose:* Create complete project directory structure, initial configurations, and scaffolding.

*** 2. [TECH]-SETUP.org - Technology Environment
#+BEGIN_SRC
"create [TECHNOLOGY]-SETUP.org for [SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT/PLATFORM]"
#+END_SRC

*Purpose:* Development environment, build tools, language-specific configuration.

*** 3. [INFRASTRUCTURE]-SETUP.org - Supporting Systems
#+BEGIN_SRC
"show [INFRASTRUCTURE]-SETUP.org"
#+END_SRC

*Purpose:* CI/CD, GitHub integration, project management, documentation systems.

*** 4. SHARED-SETUP.org - Cross-Project Infrastructure
#+BEGIN_SRC
"i want a SHARED-SETUP.org that creates directories for [PROJECT MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE] as well as [TOOL INTEGRATIONS]"
#+END_SRC

*Purpose:* Reusable infrastructure, command systems, research frameworks.

** Tangling and Cleanup Process
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# For each .org file:
1. Generate .org file with AI assistance
2. Review and validate structure
3. Tangle (extract) actual files from org blocks
4. Test generated structure
5. Remove .org file after successful extraction
6. Commit with detailed git notes
#+END_SRC

* Phase 3: Systematic Development with Issue Tracking

** Issue-Driven Development Pattern
Every change, however small, follows this pattern:

*** 1. Issue Creation
#+BEGIN_SRC
"add a gh issue for [DESCRIPTION] then [IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTION]"
#+END_SRC

*** 2. Implementation
#+BEGIN_SRC
"implement that change" OR "ok, smallest possible change to implement that"
#+END_SRC

*** 3. Verification
#+BEGIN_SRC
"gmake lint test verify" OR project-specific validation commands
#+END_SRC

*** 4. Closure
#+BEGIN_SRC
Close issue with detailed implementation notes and verification results
#+END_SRC

** Git Workflow Template
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Every commit follows this pattern:
git add [files]
git commit -m "[type]([scope]): [description]

- [Detail 1]
- [Detail 2]
- [Verification steps]

Closes #[issue]" --trailer "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Always add git notes:
git notes add -m "Session prompts used:
- [Prompt 1]: [Context and outcome]
- [Prompt 2]: [Context and outcome]
- [Summary of session achievements]"
#+END_SRC

* Phase 4: Quality Assurance and Formal Methods

** Formal Specification Integration
*** When to Add Formal Methods
- Critical system behavior
- Safety-critical operations  
- Complex state management
- API contracts and interfaces

*** TLA+ Specification Pattern
#+BEGIN_SRC
"can you create a spec for the [SYSTEM COMPONENT] of the [PROJECT]"
#+END_SRC

*** Alloy Model Pattern  
#+BEGIN_SRC
"create an alloy model for [STRUCTURAL VALIDATION] of [COMPONENT]"
#+END_SRC

** Verification Pipeline
#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
# Standard verification targets:
verify: verify-tla verify-alloy
lint: lint-code lint-scripts
test: test-unit test-integration
build: compile package
#+END_SRC

* Phase 5: Advanced Features and Self-Hosting

** Command System Development
*** Slash Command Pattern
#+BEGIN_SRC
"add /[command] command that [FUNCTIONALITY]"
#+END_SRC

*** Help System
#+BEGIN_SRC
"implement /help command showing all available commands"
#+END_SRC

** Self-Analysis and Capability Assessment
*** Regular Self-Assessment
#+BEGIN_SRC
"/self-analyze"
#+END_SRC

*Purpose:* Document current capabilities, limitations, and growth opportunities.

** Research Integration
*** Systematic Research Documentation
#+BEGIN_SRC
"/research [topic]"
#+END_SRC

*Structure:*
#+BEGIN_SRC
research/[topic]/
├── README.org         # Overview and findings
├── sources.org        # Bibliography
├── notes/            # Detailed investigation
└── recommendations.org
#+END_SRC

* Prompt Templates by Development Phase

** Project Initialization
#+BEGIN_SRC
1. "[BASIC FUNCTIONALITY] using [TECH STACK] in [FORMAT]"
2. "[INTERFACE] should use [PATTERN]" 
3. "start by using [METHODOLOGY] to [ENSURE QUALITY]"
4. "show a SETUP.org that builds out initial files"
#+END_SRC

** Feature Development
#+BEGIN_SRC
1. "add a gh issue for [FEATURE] then implement"
2. "smallest possible change to implement [REQUIREMENT]"
3. "add [COMMAND/FUNCTION] that [BEHAVIOR]"
4. "fix [ISSUE] with [APPROACH]"
#+END_SRC

** Quality and Testing
#+BEGIN_SRC
1. "gmake lint test verify"
2. "add tests for [FUNCTIONALITY]"
3. "create formal spec for [COMPONENT]"
4. "run security review on [SYSTEM]"
#+END_SRC

** Documentation and Analysis
#+BEGIN_SRC
1. "/mise-en-place" - workspace organization
2. "/self-analyze" - capability assessment  
3. "/research [topic]" - investigate area
4. "/security-review" - security analysis
#+END_SRC

* Iteration and Improvement Patterns

** After Each Development Session
1. **Document all prompts** in git notes
2. **Update this template** with new patterns discovered
3. **Commit template changes** with methodology notes
4. **Prepare for next iteration** with clean starting point

** Template Evolution Process
#+BEGIN_SRC
Session N: Use current template → Document new patterns
Session N+1: Update template → Test improvements  
Session N+2: Refine template → Validate methodology
Repeat: Continuous template improvement
#+END_SRC

** Methodology Metrics
Track these metrics across iterations:
- Time from vision to working prototype
- Number of prompts to achieve functionality
- Quality gate success rate
- Template reusability across projects

* Anti-Patterns and Lessons Learned

** Avoid These Patterns
*** 1. Undocumented Prompts
*Problem:* Losing reproducibility and learning
*Solution:* Always document in git notes

*** 2. Monolithic Changes
*Problem:* Hard to debug and verify
*Solution:* "Smallest possible change" approach

*** 3. Skipping Quality Gates
*Problem:* Technical debt accumulation
*Solution:* Always run lint/test/verify before commit

*** 4. Missing Issue Tracking
*Problem:* Lost context and decision history
*Solution:* Create issue for every change

** Successful Patterns to Amplify
*** 1. Literate Programming
*Benefit:* Rapid, comprehensive project generation
*Application:* Use .org files for major structure changes

*** 2. Formal Methods Integration
*Benefit:* Safety constraints and behavior validation
*Application:* Critical system components and APIs

*** 3. Systematic Documentation
*Benefit:* Perfect reproducibility and knowledge transfer
*Application:* Every prompt, decision, and outcome

*** 4. Issue-Driven Development
*Benefit:* Complete traceability and context preservation
*Application:* All changes, even trivial ones

* Next Iteration Preparation

** Before Starting Next Project
1. **Review this template** for completeness
2. **Prepare development environment** with tools
3. **Define success criteria** for the iteration
4. **Set up tracking systems** (git, issues, documentation)

** Success Criteria for Template Validation
- [ ] Can reproduce project from scratch using only this template
- [ ] All major methodologies documented with examples  
- [ ] Reusable patterns extracted and tested
- [ ] Quality gates integrated and validated
- [ ] Documentation systems functional

** Template Improvement Areas
*Current gaps to address in next iteration:*
- [ ] Automated testing integration patterns
- [ ] Deployment and distribution workflows
- [ ] Multi-language project templates

- [ ] Performance optimization methodologies

---

*This template represents the distilled methodology for AI-assisted software development, designed for infinite iteration and continuous improvement.*

** Meta-Learning Loop
#+BEGIN_SRC
Use Template → Document Discoveries → Update Template → Test Improvements → Repeat
#+END_SRC

Each iteration makes the next one more efficient and effective.

** Repository Template Checklist
When starting fresh:
- [ ] Initialize git repository
- [ ] Set up direnv for environment management
- [ ] Create .env.example with all configuration options
- [ ] Establish conventional commit patterns
- [ ] Set up issue tracking with labels
- [ ] Configure quality gates (lint/test/verify)
- [ ] Document methodology in PROMPTS.org
- [ ] Track all prompts in git notes

*End of from-scratch template. Ready for infinite iteration and improvement.*
