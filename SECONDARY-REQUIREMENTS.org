#+AUTHOR: AYGP-DR
#+DATE: 2025-07-26

* Overview

This document captures additional requirements discovered through analyzing issues, feature requests, and bug reports from previous sage implementations (versions 001-008). These requirements supplement the primary requirements and address real-world usage patterns, security vulnerabilities, and performance concerns.

* Security Requirements (Critical)

** SR-001: Path Traversal Prevention [CRITICAL]
*Source*: sage-005#21, sage-007#42

The tool system MUST prevent path traversal attacks:
- Validate all paths are within workspace
- Reject paths containing =..= or absolute paths
- Resolve symlinks and validate destination
- Use =std::fs::canonicalize= for path normalization

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
// Example validation
fn validate_path(path: &Path, workspace: &Path) -> Result<PathBuf> {
    let canonical = path.canonicalize()?;
    if !canonical.starts_with(workspace) {
        bail!("Path escapes workspace");
    }
    Ok(canonical)
}
#+END_SRC

** SR-002: API Key Security [HIGH]
*Source*: sage#55, sage-006#29

MUST prevent API key exposure:
- Never log API keys at any log level
- Mask keys in error messages (show only last 4 chars)
- Scrub keys from stack traces
- Implement secure key storage option

** SR-003: Command Injection Prevention [HIGH]
*Source*: sage-005#25, sage-008#18

When implementing command execution:
- Use strict whitelist of allowed commands
- Never pass user input directly to shell
- Use =std::process::Command= with explicit args
- Sandbox execution environment

* Performance Requirements

- Support context injection

* Tool System Enhancements

** SR-011: Minimal Tool Set [HIGH]
*Source*: Analysis of sage-007#41

Research shows 4 tools cover 40-50% of use cases:
1. =read_file= - Read file contents
2. =write_file= - Write/create files
3. =list_files= - Browse directories
4. =search_files= - Search with patterns

Adding these covers 80-85%:
5. =run_command= - Execute whitelisted commands
6. =edit_file= - Modify existing files

Only invoke tools when necessary:
- Analyze query for tool indicators
- Implement cost-benefit analysis
- Allow manual tool toggle
- Show tool consideration in debug

* User Interface Improvements
