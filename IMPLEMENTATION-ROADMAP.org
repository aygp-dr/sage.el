* Implementation Sequence Rationale

** Why Foundation First?
Analysis of failed implementations shows that skipping foundational work leads to:
- Unstable REPL behavior
- Poor error handling
- Security vulnerabilities retrofitted badly
- Technical debt that blocks progress

** Why Context Before Tools?
Tool usage patterns from previous versions show:
- 80% of tool usage happens in multi-turn conversations
- Single-turn tool usage is limited and less valuable
- Context enables complex tool workflows
- Session persistence is critical for user satisfaction

** Why Security With Tools?
Security vulnerabilities in sage-005 and others show:
- Retrofitting security is much harder
- Path traversal attacks are trivial to exploit
- Users need sandboxing from day one
- Security testing must be comprehensive

** Why Production Features Last?
Performance and polish features should come after stability:
- Core functionality must be rock-solid first
- User experience improvements build on stable foundation
- Optimization is meaningless without correctness
- Production features require complete system testing

* Risk Mitigation

** High-Risk Areas
1. **Signal Handling**: Multiple versions failed here
2. **Tool Security**: Critical vulnerability if done wrong
3. **Context Management**: Easy to lose user data
4. **API Changes**: Google APIs evolve rapidly

** Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit + Integration + TTY tests
2. **Security-First Design**: Sandbox from day one
3. **Data Persistence**: Auto-save and backup
4. **API Abstraction**: Clean separation layers

* Success Metrics

** Phase Completion Criteria

*** Phase 1: Foundation
- All basic REPL operations work
- API integration stable
- Clean test suite
- No crashes on edge cases

*** Phase 2: Context
- Multi-turn conversations perfect
- Session save/load reliable
- Token counting accurate
- Context commands complete

*** Phase 3: Tools
- Security audit passes
- Self-hosting works
- Tool calling reliable
- No privilege escalation

*** Phase 4: Production
- Performance targets met
- Error handling comprehensive
- User experience polished
- Ready for real users

* Timeline Estimates

| Phase | Duration | Features | Risk |
|-------+----------+----------+------|
| 1 | 2 weeks | 4 feature sets | Low |
| 2 | 2 weeks | 4 feature sets | Medium |
| 3 | 2 weeks | 4 feature sets | High |
| 4 | 2 weeks | 4 feature sets | Medium |
| 5 | Open-ended | Extensions | Low |

Total MVP: **8 weeks** for production-ready system

* Architecture Decisions

** Core Principles
1. **Security by Design**: Sandbox everything from start
2. **Async by Default**: Use Tokio throughout
3. **Error Transparency**: Clear error messages and recovery
4. **Test-Driven**: Write tests before features
5. **Configuration-Driven**: Minimize hard-coded behavior

** Technology Choices
- **REPL**: =rustyline= for readline functionality
- **HTTP**: =reqwest= with async support
- **Serialization**: =serde= + =serde_json=
- **CLI**: =clap= with derive macros
- **Logging**: =log= + =env_logger=
- **Testing**: Built-in test framework + property tests

** Design Patterns
- **Command Pattern**: For extensible command system
- **Strategy Pattern**: For multiple tool implementations
- **Observer Pattern**: For logging and monitoring
- **Builder Pattern**: For configuration management

* Lessons from Previous Versions

** What Worked Well
1. **Incremental Development**: Each version built on previous learnings
2. **Language-Specific Strengths**: Leveraging unique language features
3. **Educational Focus**: Clear documentation and examples
4. **Security Consciousness**: Later versions prioritized security

** What Didn't Work
1. **Over-Engineering**: Complex build systems hindered progress
2. **Incomplete Error Handling**: Led to poor user experience
3. **Security Afterthoughts**: Vulnerabilities in deployed systems
4. **Missing Tests**: Same bugs appeared across versions

** Key Insights
1. **Start Simple**: MVP first, then evolve
2. **Security First**: Design boundaries early
3. **Test Everything**: Especially edge cases and security
4. **User Experience Matters**: Performance and reliability are features
5. **Documentation Enables**: Good docs accelerate development
